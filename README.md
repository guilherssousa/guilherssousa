## üõ† Hi, nice to meet you 

I like to consider myself as a software craftsman. Most of the time we are not coding but concerning on methods to solve the adversities we are introduced. Therefore, we are more than just coders! Well, also because most of the time my code isn't productive at all.

- Fullstack Developer at [Mais Esports](https://maisesports.com.br/), also a open source contributor and 15-minute writer.
- Most side projects are [Pok√©mon](https://github.com/guilherssousa/mew-machine) and Esports.
- I code mostly in JS/TS, but I'm also use Python and Go when it's needed. :)
 
### Projects

My featured project is the [Mew Machine](https://github.com/guilherssousa/mew-machine), a Python implementation of the Lost Mew Distribution Machine. Currently, I'm maintaining these projects:
- [My website](https://guilherssousa.dev) where I talk more about myself and write about projects and studies.
- [Pok√©co](https://github.com/guilherssousa/pokeco), a Pok√©dex progress assistant I'm building as a side project, still a WIP.

### Contributions

I contributed to some open source projects, some of them: [electron/electron](https://www.electronjs.org/pt), [pnpm/pnpm](https://pnpm.io/pt), [alvarotrigo/fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js), [vercel/swr-site](https://swr.vercel.app/pt-BR).
