1## Hi, nice to meet you :)

I like to consider myself as a software craftsman. Most of the time we are not coding but concerning on methods to solve the adversities we are introduced. Therefore, we are more than just coders!

- Fullstack Developer at [Mais Esports](https://maisesports.com.br/), also a open source contributor 15-minute writer.
- Most side projects are [Pokémon](https://github.com/guilherssousa/mew-machine) and Esports.
- Also content creator on [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@guisousadev).
 
### Projects

My featured project is the [Mew Machine](https://github.com/guilherssousa/mew-machine), a Python implementation of the Lost Mew Distribution Machine. Currently, I'm maintaining these projects:
- [My website](https://guilherssousa.dev) where I talk more about myself and write about projects and studies.
- [Pokéco](https://github.com/guilherssousa/pokeco), a Pokédex progress assistant I'm building as a side project, still a WIP.

### Contributions

I contributed to some open source projects, some of them: [electron/electron](https://www.electronjs.org/pt), [pnpm/pnpm](https://pnpm.io/pt), [alvarotrigo/fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js), [vercel/swr-site](https://swr.vercel.app/pt-BR).
