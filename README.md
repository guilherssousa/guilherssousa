## ðŸ›  Hi, nice to meet you 

I like to consider myself as a software craftsman. Most of the time we are not coding but concerning on methods to solve the adversities we are introduced. Therefore, we are more than just coders, right? Well, also because most of the time my code isn't productive at all.

- Fullstack Developer at [Mais Esports](https://maisesports.com.br/), also a open source contributor and 15-minute writer.
- Most side projects are [PokÃ©mon](https://github.com/guilherssousa/mew-machine) and Esports.
- I code mostly in JS/TS, but I'm also using Python and Go when it's needed. :)
- Majoring in Software Engineering at Universidade EstÃ¡cio de SÃ¡.
