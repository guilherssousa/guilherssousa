## Hi, nice to meet you :)

- Fullstack Developer at [Mais Esports](https://maisesports.com.br/), also a freelancer.
- Thinking since 2004, crafting since 2018.
- I like to build projects and contribute to open source during spare time.
- My hobbies are [Pokémons](https://github.com/guilherssousa/mew-machine) and Esports, so don't get surprised by number of repositories on this subject. :)
- Currently making a TikTok series where I build a TV app to order food.
 
### Projects

My featured project is the [Mew Machine](https://github.com/guilherssousa/mew-machine), a Python implementation of the Lost Mew Distribution Machine.

Currently, I'm maintaining these projects:
- [My website](https://guilherssousa.dev) where I talk more about myself and write about projects and studies.
- [Pokéco](https://github.com/guilherssousa/pokeco), a Pokédex progress assistant I'm building as a side project, still a WIP.

### Contributions

I contributed to some open source projects, some of them: [electron/electron](https://www.electronjs.org/pt), [pnpm/pnpm](https://pnpm.io/pt), [alvarotrigo/fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js), [vercel/swr-site](https://swr.vercel.app/pt-BR)
